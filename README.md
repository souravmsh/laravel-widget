## Usage

### 1. Add the Font Hunter Widget

#### **Font Hunter** is a Laravel widget that provides a reusable Blade component (x-laravel-widget::font-hunter) to download Google Fonts and their associated CSS files. Users can input a Google Fonts CSS URL, fetch the font files along with a custom CSS, and download them as a zip archive. The widget is styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive interface and integrates seamlessly into any Laravel Blade view.

In your Blade view:

```blade
<x-laravel-widget::font-hunter 
    title="Font Hunter" 
    description="Download any font by entering the URL of the font file."
/>
```

### Workflow

1. Enter a valid Google Fonts CSS URL (example: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400,700`).
2. Click **Generate** to fetch the fonts and CSS.
3. A **Download** button appears to download a zip archive containing the fonts and a generated CSS file.

## Configuration

Customize the package settings in `config/laravel-widget.php`:

```php
return [
    'dir' => storage_path('app/public/laravel-widget/'),
    'fonts_dir' => 'fonts/',
    'css_dir' => 'css/',
    'file_name' => 'fonts.css',
];
```

You can adjust:

* The base storage path
* Subdirectories for fonts and CSS
* Default CSS filename

## Customization

* **Styling**: To modify the widget‚Äôs appearance, edit `resources/views/vendor/laravel-widget/components/font-hunter.blade.php`.
* **Form Handling**: Optionally convert the form to AJAX-based by adding your custom JS.
* **Additional Widgets**: Future widgets can be added by creating new Blade components within this package.

---

## Notes

* Files are stored at `storage/app/public/laravel-widget/`. Ensure this directory is writable.
* The package uses a minimal POST route `/laravel-widget/process` to handle form submissions.
* Fully compatible with Laravel 9.x and 10.x.
